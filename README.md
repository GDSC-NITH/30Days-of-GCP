<h2>About üëÄ</h2>
 <br> 
Google Cloud in collaboration with Developer Students Club (DSC) provides an opportunity to students to start their journey in cloud programming with hands-on labs on Google Cloud Platform that powers apps like Google Search, Gmail, and YouTube.
30 Days of Google Cloud program will introduce you to concepts such as Computing, Application Development, Big Data & Machine Learning using Google Cloud‚Äôs training platform ‚ÄòQwiklabs‚Äô where you will learn each of these topics using self-paced labs.

 <h2 align="center"> FAQ </h2>

#### 	üí•What is Pull Request ?

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

#### 	üí•What is Fork?

A fork is a copy of a repository that you manage. Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository. You can fetch updates from or submit changes to the original repository with pull requests.

#### 	üí•How to create a Pull Request?
[Creating Pull Request](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github)

#### 	üí•How to rebase and update Pull Request?

#### üåüYou can Star and Fork this repository üåü.


## üöÄ Quick Start :

#### Step 1: Forking the repository :

To work on this project, you will first need to make a copy of this repository. To do this, you should fork the repository and then clone it so that you have a local working copy.

Get your own Fork/Copy of this repository by clicking `Fork` button at right upper corner of your screen.<br><br>

#### Step 2: Clone the Forked Repository

After the repository is forked, you can now clone it so that you have a local working copy of the codebase.

To make your local copy of the repository follow the steps:
- Open the Command Prompt
- Type this command:
  
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/30Days-of-GCP
```


#### Step 3: Creating a new branch 
This is one of the very important step that you should follow to contribute in Open Source. A branch helps to manage the workflow, isolate your code and does not creates a mess. To create a new branch:
  
```bash
$ git branch <name_of_branch>
$ git checkout -b <name_of_branch>
```

Keep your cloned repository upto to date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)
```bash
git pull origin main
```

#### Step 5: Contribute
Make relevant changes according to the issue that you were assigned on. Contribute in any way you feel like :)

#### Step 6: Commiting and Pushing
Once you have modified an existing file or added a new file to the project, you can add it to your local repository, which is being done with the git add command.

```bash
git add .
```
With our file staged, we‚Äôll want to record the changes that we have made to the repository with the `git commit` command.

The commit message is an important aspect of your code contribution; it helps the other contributors fully understand the changes you have made, why you made it, and how significant it is.

```bash
git commit -m "useful commit message"
```

At this point you can use the git push command to push the changes to the current branch of your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

#### Step 7: Create Pull Request
Now, you are ready to make a pull request to the original repository.

You should navigate to your forked repository, and press the "Compare & pull request" button on the page.

GitHub will alert you that you can merge the two branches because there is no competing code. You should add in a title, a comment, and then press the ‚ÄúCreate pull request‚Äù button.
